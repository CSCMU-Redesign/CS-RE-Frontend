# Vue 3 + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

Learn more about IDE Support for Vue in the [Vue Docs Scaling up Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/tooling.html#ide-support).


To get started, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory (`~/CS-RE-Frontend`).

First, run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Once the installation is complete, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and you can access your Vue 3 application in your browser at the provided URL.

For more information on developing with Vue 3 in Vite, you can refer to the [official documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
